The repository consists of raw CSI and preprocessed CSI to demonstrate the phase sanitization and denoising procedure. 
### Raw CSI data in WiFiTuned/Python/preprocess/phase2
1. The repository consists of raw CSI data collected from ESP32. Phase 2 consists of the CSI data collected in varied setups.  
2. To create the Doppler phase shift spectrogram, execute the preprocess_doppler.ipynb code file. 

### Raw CSI data in WiFiTuned/Python/processed_phase/phase2
1. The repository consists of clean CSI data collected from ESP31. We perform the phase sanitization and denoising techniques to clean the CSI data. 
2. To create the Doppler phase shift spectrogram, execute the postprocess_doppler.ipynb code file.


### Raw CSI data in WiFiTuned/Python/preprocess/phase3
1. The repository consists of raw CSI data collected from Intel AX200.  
2. To create the Doppler phase shift spectrogram, execute the preprocess_doppler.ipynb code file.
