The repository consists of raw CSI and preprocessed CSI to demonstrate the phase sanitization and denoising procedure. 
### Raw CSI data in WiFiTuned/Python/preprocess/phase2
1. The repository consists of raw CSI data. Phase 2 consists of the CSI data collected in varied setups.  
2. To create the Doppler phase shift spectrogram, execute the preprocess_doppler.ipynb code file. 

### Raw CSI data in WiFiTuned/Python/processed_phase/phase2
1. The repository consists of clean CSI data. We perform the phase sanitization and denoising techniques to clean the CSI data. 
2. To create the Doppler phase shift spectrogram, execute the postprocess_doppler.ipynb code file.


### Raw CSI data in WiFiTuned/Python/preprocess/phase3
1. The repository consists of raw CSI data. Phase 3 consists of CSI data collected from the CSI data.  
2. To create the Doppler phase shift spectrogram, execute the preprocess_doppler.ipynb code file.
